    is the first web browser and web page editor. <br>It was discontinued in 1994. <br>At the time it was written, it was the sole web browser in existence, as well as the first WYSIWYG HTML editor.
<br>The source code was released into the public domain on 30 April 1993. <br>Some of the code still resides on Tim Berners-Lee's NeXT Computer in the CERN museum and has not been recovered due to the computer's status as a historical artifact.
<br>To coincide with the 20th anniversary of the research center giving the web to the world, a project began in 2013 at CERN to preserve this original hardware and software associated with the birth of the Web. </p>
