  <h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="JavaScript specification">JavaScript</a>  often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. <br>As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. <br>All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
  <br>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. <br>It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. <br>It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. <br>It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
